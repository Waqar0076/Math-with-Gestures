# Math with Gestures using AI

This project leverages AI to recognize mathematical gestures and perform corresponding calculations, as well as create drawings using CV Zone, basic Python logics, and a web-based UI.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Recognition**: Recognizes hand gestures using Mediapipe for performing math operations.
- **AI-Powered Math Solver**: Utilizes Google Generative AI (Gemini) to solve math problems based on hand-drawn equations.
- **Interactive Drawing**: Allows users to draw on-screen using hand gestures.


## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Virtual environment tool (optional but recommended).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
